#Database-Driven Javascript Quiz Game

Implement a database schema that stores the question/answer information necessary for your quiz game. Then build a generated view that pulls the quiz data from the database. It should behave exactly like the "2. Alternative Javascript Quiz Game" section's result does. The difference is that you're loading information from a database instead of hard-coding it into the HTML.
